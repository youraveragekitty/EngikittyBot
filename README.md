## About me

I started learning C# quite a few months ago through game modding and then made a bot in JavaScript; it was bad, unoptimized and the code was really really ugly.
So, with my newly acquired magical C# powers I decided to make my own bot, and surprise, NetCord is dozens of times more performant and dozens of times more readable!

## About the bot

This bot runs using [NetCord](https://github.com/NetCordDev/NetCord) and tightly optimized code to run on small systems. Though, it's still messy as I made it in a rush. (Will organize it in newer releases)\
It also uses the [Neon Postsgre Database](https://neon.com)!

## Usage

There are two ways of using this bot:
1. Server
2. Personal computer

### Server

This bot was MADE to be ran on a server, and it is easy to do so.\
For example, you can use Render to host it, though it is paid unless you use the Website worker with a few not very legal hacky hacks.

**If you want to do some tweaks..**

1. Download [the latest release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)'s source code .zip
2. Do the tweaks you want to do
3. Use Git to push it to your repo
4. Follow the instructions on Render
5. Add in the environment variables those:\
"DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_ENGIKITTY": the bot's auth token\
"ENGIKITTY_GROQ_KEY": the API key that will be used for the API
6. You're done

2. Add in the environment variables those:\

## About /tts

The `/tts` command speaks through the same read-aloud service Microsoft Edge uses, by way of
[Edge_tts_sharp](https://github.com/Entity-Now/Edge_tts_sharp). There is no key, no account and
no quota to set up, so it works the moment the bot starts.

Around 300 voices are on offer across 70-odd languages; start typing a name, a language or a
country in the `voice` option and the autocomplete will find them. Speed goes from 0.5x to 2x.
